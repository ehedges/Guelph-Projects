Compile: type "make", use ./a3 -g or ./a3 <#> <#> to run the program. 

Notes: The time it prints out is the elapseed time, an approximation of how long a stopwatch
woud take to time the program. It is recorded in seconds. I believe this is the correct way to
measure it because it demonstrates the elapsed time and how much
time can be gained by using llel. If the matrix is too large it may
kill the program. (35000 was too big, 32000 could be executed).

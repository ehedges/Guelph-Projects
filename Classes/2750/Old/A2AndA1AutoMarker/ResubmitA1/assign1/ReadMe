Compile: Type make or make all. I used make test to create executable test to test.

Limitations:

createGEDCOM has minimal error checking. CONT or CONC is not looked for.

printGEDCOM works.

delete GEDCOM, has memory leaks, may segfault.

printError, works.

findperson, untested, no compare is provided.

getDescendants(). Unused.

Misc:
Used Denis's linked list provided. No changes were made to it.

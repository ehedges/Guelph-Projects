Everything should be implemented.No extra libraries so npm install should work. Tested on the school servers. Use Make,make all or make dynamic in the parser directory to compile (gcc -shared -o ../VCardlib.so $(LL) $(VCARD) $(VUTIL)
is how it is compiled).

Limitations:

Server sometimes crashes. Does not display the error message if uploading an invalid file.

Misc:

All functions should be implemented and working. I include the dates (Birthday and Anniversary) in the optional properties count (this was never specified).

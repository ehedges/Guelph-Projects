   Included in the librarysearch package is a set of java classes for the library search system.  The user can add a book or a journal at a time and search for the relevant references in terms of a call number, title keywords, or a time period with starting and ending years.  

   To build the system, go to the inside of "librarysearch" folder and do the following:

      javac *.java

   To run the system, go one-level above so that you can see the "librarysearch" folder and do either:

      java librarysearch.LibrarySearch

   or 

      java librarysearch.LibrarySearchDemo

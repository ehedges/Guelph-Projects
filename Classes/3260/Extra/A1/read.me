Compile: 

Run ruby test.rb.

Design Choices:

Dies can have minimium of 3 sides. This is done because a coin can be used as a 2 sided die, 1 sided die returns the same
value and you can't have negative sided die.

Limitations:

When creating a die with less than 3 sides, the code can break. When creating a die with the wrong colour, it doesn't
return nil but doesn't have values? Load doesn't always work with collections. 

Misc:

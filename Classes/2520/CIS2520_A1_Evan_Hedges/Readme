References:

Used pseudocode of Heap's Algorithm from: http://desple.com/post/118425815657/permutations-with-heaps-algorithm-in-javascript

Limitations: 

A: Need to delete carbon.txt before running, otherwise it may add the output to the file again. 



B:

Ackermann's Function segfaults if too big. 

C:

Infinite loops on negative values. May crash if it fails to get time.

Compile:

Navigate to the location of the folder type "make tree" for the tree implementation and "make heap" for the heap implementation. 

Running the program:

Type ./a3tree EXPRESSION to use the tree. Type ./a3heap for the heap implementation. 

Limitations: 

Tree:

1. Display: Sort of works. It prints out a rought tree shape, but without lines.
2. Preorder: Working.
3. Inorder: WOrking.
4. Postorder: WOrking.

5. Update : Accepts the first number, even if it is followed by letters. Can't be a number larger than the amount of unknowns. Rejects input if letter precede the number.

6. Calculate: Calculates, can't divide by 0 or else it will exit. All variables are initially 0.
7. Exit: working.

Misc: Won't accept non x variables. Segfaults with invalid brackets. Max input size of 1k. Requires most embeded ( to be on the left. Basic error checking. Crashs with invalid brackets.  


Heap: f.dat is hardcoded into the program, so it must be in the same folder. It does not check for invalid files.

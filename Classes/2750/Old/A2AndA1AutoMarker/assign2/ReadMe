Compile: Type make or make all. I used make test to create executable test to test.

Limitations:

write works, but may fail due to weird things with test harness

The ancestors/descendants sometimes have extra [] for black stuff.
Delete will crash the generation lists will crash the program.

the String related stuff works. 

Misc:
Used Denis's linked list provided. No changes were made to it.

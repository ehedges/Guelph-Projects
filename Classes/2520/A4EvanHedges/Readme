Compile:

Navigate to the location of the folder type "make" to compile . 

Running the program:

Type ./avltree EXPRESSION to use the tree. 

Limitations: 

Sometimes after doing another option, intializing again may open the same file, and cause an infinite loop or crash. 
The file takes along time to upload (like a minute or 2 for data.txt). 
Lead nodes heights is zero. There is no error checking preventing anytype of file being uploaded, but it will prevent non-existant files from being uploaded.

Tree:

1. Initalize: Works but takes a while.
2. Find: Works
3. Insert: Works
4. Remove: Does not work
5. Check height/size: Works, but the height maybe alittle off.
6. Find Frequency: Works
7. Exit: Works

Misc: Code is messy and long. Used kukuruku.co/hub/cpp/avl-trees as reference.

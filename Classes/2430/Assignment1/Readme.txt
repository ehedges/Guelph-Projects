Running:
Navigate to the location the folder was downloaded. Type javac Assignment1.java.  Type java Assignment1 to run. 

Using a 3 if statements rather than a switch to ensure easier case checking. Example is the quit. I would have to create multiple cases that have the same code rather than putting all the 
conditions in an if statment. 

Using:
The program will prompt the user for input. Follow the directions, type into the command line and enter to procced. 

Limitations:
Does not search.

Testing:
Tested Q,q Quit, QUIT and Quit: Works. Tested inputing various numbers letters and characters into the name, author and publisher/organization: Doesn't affect the program. Test inputting 
non numbers into the year: does not crash and requires proper input. Requires there to be a title, publication year and call number. The title must be longer than 1 letter.
Tested no input: title, call number and year is required. Does not duplicate same items.
